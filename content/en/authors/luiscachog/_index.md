##### \$whoami

I'm a dedicated husband, avid Soccer fanatic, beer lover, and fond of all things GNU/Linux.
I'm a Security Systems Administrator with Cloud/DevOps/Security skills working at [Rackspace](https://rackspace.com).
I am actively contributing to [Open Source projects](/projects) and define myself as a Linux enthusiast who loves to work and experiment with Open Source technologies while I am learning.
I enjoy attend meetups and events to learn about new technologies, talk with interesting people and exchange stickers.
I learn new stuff every day and I like to share; sometimes I write about it on this blog.

 Iâ€™m active on Linked in and Github, and occassionally on Twitter.
