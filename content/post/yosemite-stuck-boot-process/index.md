Sometimes, I'm having problems with my Mac, when it's sleep (hibernate) and I tried to "wake up" the Mac doesn't start, and it shows me a Black Screen.
So, I've rebooted and after that it is stuck on the boot process.

So, I've found these solution to avoid that Yosemite stuck on the boot process:

A. Enter to Single-user or verbose mode

  1. Shutdown the Mac

  1. Press the power button to start the computer

  1. Immediately press and hold the Command Key and either of the following

    * the "s" key for single-user mode (Command-S)
    * the "v" key for verbose mode (Command-V)

B. When you login on the Mac, you should run the following commands:

    ```shell
      /sbin/mount -uw /
      rm -rf /System/Library/Caches/*
      rm /private/var/db/BootCache.playlsit
      reboot
    ```

After the reboot, your Mac will boot as always.
